## Project description

<p align="justify">
The "To-Do List" is a simple task management application where users can efficiently add, update, complete, and remove tasks.

The app was developed as a personal project with the aim of creating an online task list to assist with daily organization. The interface was designed by a designer in Figma, ensuring an attractive and intuitive layout, and I implemented it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in VS Code, allowing me to practice my skills.

In addition to the basic functionalities of adding, updating, and removing tasks, the "To-Do List" also offers other features such as the ability to mark tasks as completed and hide or show completed tasks. This allows users to focus on pending tasks and keep their list organized.

## Features

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 1: Add new tasks to the list

:heavy_check_mark: Feature 3: Mark tasks as completed
